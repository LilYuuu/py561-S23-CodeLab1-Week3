# Lily's HW3: Saving Data

For this assignment, I used last week's game as a starting point and added the feature of displaying time used for the game.

Different from the in-class example where number of prizes collected is used as score, I kept track of time by utilizing `Time.timeSinceLevelLoad` and compared each record with the shortest time saved.
